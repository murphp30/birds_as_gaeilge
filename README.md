# birds_as_gaeilge
A bot for posting the names of birds in English and Irish to mastodon.

## Sources
List of bird names comes from Colm Ó Caomhánaigh's [Dictionary of Bird Names in Irish](http://gofree.indigo.ie/~cocaomh/HomePage.htm)

## TODO
- Improve wording of posts
- something about how this is the "standard name"
- Unnecessary SQL database of birds?
